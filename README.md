# MT_spiking-attractor-memory-network-model-with-non-orthogonal-patterns
# mynetwork_final.py includes the code for the designed spiking attractor memory network model with non-orthogonal patterns, the 
# simulated delayed-response task (with disruptor) the network's capacity is checked and compared with as well as the plot displaying
# the spike raster of the Minicolumns and the weight of the synapse between Minicolum 0  of Hypercolum 0 and 2.
# The different configurations necessary and the parameters which are scaled for the different tasks
# (amount of HCs, overlap percentage, whether to include a distractor) are annoted in the respective line.
# After running the simulation, obtained values are saved in files (https://figshare.com/s/6066b6a39b7c54c4faa3) and are plotted
# in bar plots with the code in the file with the respective figure's name.
